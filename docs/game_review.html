          <h1>Welcome to Elderfield</h1>
          <p>For my latest DIGIT project, I am doing a game review on <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i>. While playing this game, I found the characters within it very intriguing. It is clear the developer took inspiration from manga artist Junji Ito while forming the artistic style of <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i>'s characters. This interesting style contributes to the game's sense of horror and eerieness, while still allowing players to fully customize their own protagonist. The game is still in early development but, even so, there is a lot to explore and many mysteries to solve.</p>
          
          <p>The NPC's within <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i> are extremely important. They offer gifts, quests, and resources to aid you on your journey. Certain decisions you make and the way you treat these characters will raise or lower your level of friendship individually. The stronger your friendship is with a character, the more likely they are to help you.</p>
          
          <div class="responsive">
              <div class="gallery">
                  <a target="_self" href="https://github.com/kar6828/portfolio/blob/main/docs/Screenshot%202025-04-28%20150922.png?raw=true">
                      <img src="https://github.com/kar6828/portfolio/blob/main/docs/Screenshot%202025-04-28%20150922.png?raw=true" alt="Welcome to Elderfield" width="600" height="400">
                      </img>    </a> 
                  <div class="desc">A screenshot from <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i></div>
              </div>
          </div>
          

        <p>The purpose of the game is to investigate and solve the vast number of mysteries that appear around Elderfield. The beginning of summer vacation has begun, giving you plenty of time to take on these tasks. However, they do not come without a challenge. Along the way you will run into many enemies that range from monsters and spirits to angry shoppers.</p>
          
          <p>The relationships between different aspects of the game run deep. I took the time to analyze these relationships and display them in an effective way for people who have never played the game.</p>
