          <h1>Welcome to Elderfield</h1>
          <p>For my latest DIGIT project, I am doing a game review on <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i>. While playing this game, I found the characters within it very intriguing. It is clear the developer took inspiration from manga artist Junji Ito while forming the artistic style of <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i>'s characters. This interesting style contributes to the game's sense of horror and eerieness, while still allowing players to fully customize their own protagonist.</p>

              <p>The art style plays into the setting of the game as well, being very dark with broken down buildings and coves readily available to explore. The game is still in early development but, even so, there is a lot to explore and many mysteries to solve.</p>
          
          <p>The NPC's within <i>Welcome to Elderfield</i> are extremely important. They offer gifts, quests, and resources to aid you on your journey. Certain decisions you make and the way you treat these characters will raise or lower your level of friendship individually. The stronger your friendship is with a character, the more likely they are to help you. It is hard to get to know all of the characters super well without full access to the game, but there are some traits that are obvious and they can be found in my embed below.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the game is to investigate and solve the vast number of mysteries that appear around Elderfield. The beginning of summer vacation has begun, giving you plenty of time to take on these tasks. However, they do not come without a challenge. Along the way you will run into many enemies that range from monsters and spirits to angry shoppers. To defeat these enemies, you can collect resources on the ground and in garbage cans throughout the map. With the resources, you can create weapons and armor to help you during your travels. Speaking of these, it does not seem like there are many different play-styles. The game is turn-based so stronger weapons and armors are always used in the same ways, just with more damage or higher durability respectively. As far as difficulty, the game seems rather challenging. Although, it is still hard to tell due to my limited playthrough.</p>
          
          <p>The relationships between different aspects of the game run deep. I took the time to analyze these relationships and display them in an effective way for people who have never played the game.</p>
