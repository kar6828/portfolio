          <h1>Who am I?</h1>
          <p>Hi! My name is Kendall Rodriguez and I am currently attending my first year at Penn State Behrend. I plan on graduating in 2028 with a <a href= "https://behrend.psu.edu/school-of-humanities-social-sciences/academic-programs/digital-media-arts-and-technology"> DIGIT</a> degree. However, I began my college education at Gannon University with the plan of pursuing a bachelors in <a href="https://www.gannon.edu/academic-offerings/health-professions-and-sciences/undergraduate/freshwater-and-marine-biology/">Freshwater Marine Biology</a>! This may seem like a big change, but I have always had a passion for audio engineering. The DIGIT major will aid me in the technological aspect of audio engineering alongside an AE certificate in the future.</p>


        <p> I have lived in Pennsylvania for most of my life. Being an AirForce brat, I moved around a lot when I was younger. However, my family and I always came back to PA.</p>
          
          <p>In my first DIGIT class, we are currently learing how to create web pages using HTML. It was a little confusing at first, but after some practice I am starting to get the hang of it.</p>
