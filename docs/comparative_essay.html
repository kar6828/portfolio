        <p>Throughout my beginner experience with coding, I jumped between two different coding environments; one of these being HyperText Machine Language (HTML) and the other being WordPress. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. There are also certain situations where I would prefer one over the other. In this short essay, I will be going into some detail concerning the differences between these two environments.</p>
        <p>HTML can be rough for beginners. I often found myself wrapped in random elements and lost within the body of my code while using this language. However, once I got the hang of it, I enjoyed the versatility of the environment. The web really is at your fingertips with HTML. There are endless possibilities and a plentitude of styling options that are only limited by your imagination. Website organization can be tricky when you're looking for a specific format but, due to the sheer number of modifications one can make, it's safe to say that HTML is the way to go if you know your way around while coding. </p>
        <p>On the other hand, WordPress is my recommendation for web-design beginners. It offers a simple, user-friendly database and occasionally guides you when you get lost. However, there is definitely a limit to what you can do with WordPress. Web design can only go so far when it almost seems that you are working with a <i>template</i>. That being said, this "template" would have been very helpful if I hadn't already learned HTML. Due to the fact that I already had, I found myself simply using HTML language within WordPress. As far as organization goes, WordPress can basically organize your website for you. While this may be exactly what some beginners are looking for, it gets in the way when you try to step outside of the box.</p>
        <p>When it comes to the experience necessary to thrive in either of these environments, WordPress takes the bacon. Someone with zero experience in web-development could work in WordPress with their problems being minimal to none. I took advantage of this while creating my PSU webpage. HTML requires the user to apply themselves to learn the language and know it well enough to organize a professional-looking website.</p>
        <p>Now that I am decently fluent in HTML, I plan on delving deeper into the styling aspect of website development. One could say my current websites are looking a little bland and I would like to commit myself to making them more unique and individualistic.
